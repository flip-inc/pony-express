# Pony Express

RESTful API generator for Express apps using [Bookshelf.js](http://bookshelfjs.org/).

## Features

+ Quickly generate a REST API for your existing Bookshelf.js models
+ Supports custom authentication and authorization for each resource
+ Extend REST endpoints with pre/post hooks or by simply overriding them for custom functionality
+ Supports custom endpoints on any resource
+ Out of the box filtering, ordering, and pagination
+ Easily extendable for fine-grained control over responses, validation, and more

## Installation

Install the `pony-express` package:

```npm install pony-express --save```

Import it and use it!

```const pony = require('pony-express');```

## Quick Start Example

### CRUD Resource for basic Todo Model

```
const pony = require('pony-express');

const Todo = require('path/to/models/todo');

class TodoResource extends pony.Resource {
  
  initialize() {
    this.Model = Todo;
  }

}

```

That's it! The above gives you the following endpoints:

+ [GET] `todos` -> Gets a list of todos
+ [GET] `todos/:id` -> Gets a specific todo
+ [PUT] `todos/:id` -> Updates a todo
+ [POST] `todos` -> Creates a todo
+ [DELETE] `todos/:id` -> Deletes a todo

From there, you can continue to modify resources by mounting then as an [API](docs/api.md), adding [authentication](docs/authentication.md) and [authorization](docs/authorization.md), and learning about [filtering, pagination, ordering, and more advanced resource level features](docs/resources.md).

## Documentation & Examples

The API reference is located in the [docs](docs) directory or there's a [todo example](docs/examples) to check out.
